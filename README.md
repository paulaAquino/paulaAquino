### Hello

I am a backend developer with more than 14 years of experience, most of it working with Java and Golang for web applications, also I had some experience working with Groovy, Kotlin, and Python.
I already work as a leader, supporting the team and the delivery, and doing feasibility estimates for the client. I have a lot of experience working with Agile Methodologies and believe its right use can be a great tool to increase quality and value in a team's deliveries.
