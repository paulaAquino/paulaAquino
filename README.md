I am a backend developer with more than 13 years of experience, most of it working with Java for web applications, recently I started working with Groovy, Golang, and Python.
I already work as a leader, without coding, supporting the team and the delivery, and doing feasibility estimates for the client. I have a lot of experience working with Agile Methodologies and believe its right use can be a great tool to increase quality and value in a team's deliveries.
